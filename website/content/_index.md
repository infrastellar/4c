## kk's closet / Resource Center
kkâ€™s closet is open by appointment - call or text 616.755.6160. We provide free clothing and household items to those resettling in the United States from other countries. Come to the lower level (basement) of 2200 E Michigan Ave., Lansing, MI and park in the back.

## Mission

At **4C**, our mission is to support, encourage and promote cross-cultural community connections.

## Connecting

It is hard to live in a new culture. It helps to meet people you can trust and build friendships with them. We want to connect refugees with different cultures to help build community with each other.

## Learning & Growing

People need many skills to build a new life in the United States. 4C is a community of people seeking to develop those skills and relationships so all can flourish together in Lansing. We focus on offering social activities as well as providing ESL activities for those resettling in the US.
